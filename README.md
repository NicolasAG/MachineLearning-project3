## COMP 598 - Applied Machine Learning - Project 3

The	goal of this project is to devise a	machine learning algorithm to automatically classify images of hand written digits (from 0 to 9) represented in cropped image.

These are the algorithm we used:
 - (1) A baseline learner consisting of logistic regression.
 - (2) A linear SVM.
 - (3) A fully connected feedforward neural network trained by backpropagation, where the network architecture (number of nodes / layers), learning rate and termination are determined by cross‐validation.
